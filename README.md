This is a big suite of software and it's going to be complicated to get set up.

Basically just read the comments in run_spectra.py to figure out what knobs to turn on and off.

You need the following folders. Everything with a - in front isn't a folder, but everything else is. 
Check the .gitignore to see which folders you have to add back in please.

Spectra-Processing
    Visualizations
        -put all your code for visualizing the spectra and GCM outputs here
    Spectra
        DATA
        OUT
    Planets
        -Where the bigger planet files go. I should probably figure out a way to get rid of this
    GCM-OUTPUT
        -Where the original GCM outputs go
